Clostridium Difficile Infection (C. diff, or CDI) is a highly contagious endospore forming bacterium that is thransferred through
physical contact with an infected surface. Symptoms range from diarrhea to life-threatening colitis. Elderly patients
in hospitals and nursing homes receiving antimicrobial treatment are at the highest risk of infection and roughly one in nine patients over 65 will die
within 30 days of diagnosis. In this paper, we seek to model the risk of contracting CDI in both hospital and nursing home settings given patient-to-patient
or patient-to-healthcare provider contact. We then provide recommendations for minimizing the risk and controlling the spread of CDI.

# At a glance

 * Had to kill the previous update query
 * Ran update on subset of CDI cases
 * Querying for all patients who ever had CDI

# Stress testing 

It would seem that in addition to a statistical analysis project, I am also running a pretty thorough
stress test on my workstation. This data set is intense. The update script I was running last week 
kept crashing. I set up a cron job to restart the script at the last known position if it was down but
when I checked on it the next morning, it was not even close to completing. It actually
would have taken at least 8 more days of continuously running to complete, and I just don't have that
kind of time.

So to speed things along, I decided to perform the update only on the subset of C. *diff* cases. This
is all we're really interested in anyway, but it is a little unsatisfying to not have a complete database
of descriptions to accompany the ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes, but it is not necessary.

Next, because this is the Nationwide Readmissions Database, we are interested in readmissions. What we 
currently have is every listing of C. *diff* in the database, but not every listing for those patients.

C. *diff* is interesting because it is most frequently acquired while in the hospital for a different
primary disease. Patient readmissions are tracked via the **`nrd_visitlink`** column - a non-unique
key that can be thought of as an individual patient entered each time they visit within a given calendar
year. So the only way to ensure we have every "visit" for every patient who was ever listed as having 
C. *diff* is to get the distinct list of `nrd_visitlink` IDs, and query for all records containing 
those `nrd_visitlink`s. 

This list is still very long, at 245984 distinct patients. This is good for our sample size, but bad for
our hardware. The query is simple, but the processing time required is not.

```
SELECT * 
  FROM nrd
 WHERE nrd_visitlink IN ('xv4eejr', 'xjp1wvg', 'xzi005i', ...)
```

As a personal preference, I don't like processes that I haven't seen move in over an hour. Executing this query
was taking way too long, so I decided to break the `IN` clause up by chunks of $log_2(245984) \approx 13666$ IDs
over 19 iterations. After each query, I am binding the results to a `tibble` and once the full operation completes,
it will be written to CSV. Each iteration takes about 15 minutes, so it is not fast, but at least it moves and
I am able to monitor its progress. 

As I mentioned before, these `select *` operations are very computationally expensive on a column store database,
but I'd rather run this expensive query once than realize I forgot a column and have to rerun a more specific one
again.

# Finding the FMT codes

As I mentioned in [Week 2](http://bdetweiler.github.io/projects/grad-project/grad-project-1-2018-01-21.html),
FMTs are lossy-encoded into the NRD, by way of the `PRCCSn` columns. They take Current Procedure Terminology
(CPT) codes and Healthcare Procedure Coding System (HCPCS, pronounced "hick-picks") codes and encode them into
broader categories. 

CPT codes are also known as HCPCS Level I (for Medicare purposes). This is just a technicality. What we need
to be aware of is the CPT codes are numeric, while the HCPCS codes are more specific and alpha-numeric starting
with a letter. CPT codes are copyrighted by the AMA, and I have not been able to find a comprehensive list of
codes anywhere. 

The two codes of interest are CPT code
**[44705](http://www.gastro.org/practice-management/coding/fmt-coding-guidance)** - 
*"Preparation of fecal microbiota for instillation, including assessment of donor specimen"* 
and HCPCS code **[G0455](http://hcpcscodes.org/G0455)** - 
*"Preparation with instillation of fecal microbiota by any method, including assessment of donor specimen"*.

These are then encoded to CCS code 
**95** - *"Other non-OR lower GI therapeutic procedures"*.
Other various codes, such as 
**0288T** - *"Anoscopy w/rf delivery"* 
and **45190** - *"Under Destruction Procedures on the Rectum"* 
are also categorized under CCS code **95**, so we will need to proceed with caution in assuming an FMT.

There's a good explanation of HCPCS codes [here](https://www.medicalbillingandcoding.org/hcpcs-codes/). 

# Tracking readmissions

The next step is to track patient readmissions. I haven't decided how to handle this yet. My initial thought
is to take a sort of object-oriented approach and build a list of patient records that each contain a
data frame of all of that patient's admissions. 

Then, to perform analysis, we would need to summarize each record with the data points of interst. Mostly, we're
going to be interested in boolean-type variables. Was the patient readmitted within 90 days of receiving a CDI
diagnosis? Within 30 days? Was the patient adminstered an FMT? Were they readmitted within 30 or 90 days 
after that? 

# Statistical analyses

Once we have that information we should be able to perform a logistic regression on whether FMTs make patients
more or less likely to be readmitted. It may also be interesting to run a naive Bayes model and compare the accuracy
to the logistic regression.


# Next Steps

 * Finish querying for C. *diff* cases
 * Build patient record structures
 * Model as linear logistic regression
 * Model as naive Bayes

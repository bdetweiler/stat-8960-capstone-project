                                                    insurance programs. The codes are divided into two

                                                    A modifier provides the means by which the reporting
                                                    physician or provider can indicate that a service or
                                                    procedure that has been performed has been altered by some
                                                    specific circumstance but not changed in its definition or
                                                    code. The judicious application of modifiers obviates the
                                                    necessity for separate procedure listings that may describe
                                                    the modifying circumstance. Modifiers may be used to
                                                    indicate to the recipient of a report that:

                                                    > Only part of a service was performed.
